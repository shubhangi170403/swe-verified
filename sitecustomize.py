Top-level sitecustomize to ensure our Modal logging patch is always applied.

Python will auto-import ``sitecustomize`` if it is importable on ``sys.path``.
During evaluation ``/workspace/benchmarks`` is on ``PYTHONPATH``, so placing
this file at the repo root guarantees the patch runs before swebench is used.
